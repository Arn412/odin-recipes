    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        <strong> Mac and cheese</strong> is a beloved comfort food made from macaroni pasta coated in a rich, creamy
        cheese sauce.
        The dish combines tender pasta with a velvety mixture of butter, milk, and melted cheeses, often cheddar, for a
        satisfyingly gooey texture.

    <p>Baked or stovetop, itâ€™s a versatile dish enjoyed by both children and adults.
        Simple yet indulgent, mac and cheese offers a perfect balance of creamy,
