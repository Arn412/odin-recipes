    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Spaghetti Aglio e Olio</strong> is a classic Italian pasta dish known for its simplicity and bold
        flavors. It features
        spaghetti tossed in olive oil, garlic, red pepper flakes, and parsley, creating a harmonious blend of savory,
        spicy, and aromatic elements.
    </p>
    <p>The garlic is gently sautéed in extra virgin olive oil until golden, releasing its
        rich flavor, while the red pepper flakes add a mild heat. Finished with fresh parsley and a sprinkle of Parmesan
        or Pecorino cheese (optional), this dish is a quick, comforting meal that highlights the beauty of basic,
        high-quality ingredients.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> 1 pound uncooked spaghetti </li>

        <li> ½ cup olive oil</li>

        <li>6 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>

        <li>¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>

        <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>

        <li>¼ cup chopped fresh Italian parsley</li>

        <li>1 cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water,
            stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 10 to 12 minutes.
            Drain and transfer to a pasta bowl.</li>
        <br>
        <li>While the pasta is cooking, combine olive oil and garlic in a cold skillet.
            Cook over medium heat to slowly toast garlic, about 10 minutes.
            Reduce heat to medium-low when olive oil begins to bubble.
            Cook and stir until garlic is golden brown, about another 5 minutes. Remove from heat. </li>
        <br>
        <li>Stir red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper into pasta.
            Pour in hot olive oil and garlic, and sprinkle on Italian parsley and half of the Parmigiano-Reggiano
            cheese;
            toss until combined.

        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Serve pasta topped with the remaining Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.</li>
