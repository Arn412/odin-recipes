    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        A <strong>French-style omelette</strong> is a soft, delicate egg dish known for its smooth texture and subtle
        flavor.
        Unlike its Western counterpart, it’s cooked over low heat, ensuring a creamy interior without browning the
        outside.
    </p>
    <p>Made with beaten eggs, butter, and minimal seasoning, the omelette is gently stirred and folded to achieve a
        tender, silky consistency.
        It’s often filled with simple ingredients like herbs, cheese, or mushrooms, though it can also be served plain
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 large fresh eggs</li>

        <li>½ teaspoon cold water</li>

        <li>¼ teaspoon kosher salt</li>

        <li> 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided</li>

        <li> 1 pinch cayenne or white pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk eggs, water, and salt together in a mixing bowl.
            Whisk until mixture is very liquid and whites are completely blended in, 1 or 2 minutes.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Heat 1 1/2 tablespoons butter in a 9- or 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.
            As soon as butter melts and before it starts to sizzle, pour in whisked eggs. </li>
        <br>
        <li>Reduce heat to low. Using the spatula, smooth the surface to move runny eggs to less runny spots, working
            toward an even thickness.
            As soon as the surface is wet but not runny, remove from heat.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Slide omelette to edge of the pan. Flip onto a plate with the seam-side down. Even out the shape, if
            necessary. You can tuck in the ends, if you like.
            Brush surface with a bit more butter. Dust with cayenne pepper</li>
    </ol>
